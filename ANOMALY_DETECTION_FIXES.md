# Anomaly Detection Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the two issues reported:

1. **AnomalyDetectionHook.after_step context issue**
2. **Learning rate zero division crash**

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: AnomalyDetectionHook.after_step Context Problem

**Problem**: The `AnomalyDetectionHook.after_step` method only invokes `analyze_training_step` when model, optimizer, and loss are present in kwargs, but nothing ever supplies these keywords when the hook is registered. The built-in `StepProfiler.end_step` (the only caller wired to the registry) forwards only step and step_duration, so the condition `if model is not None ...` is always false and no anomaly analysis or downstream hooks will ever run.

**Solution**: 
- Created a new `StepProfiler` class with an `end_step` method that accepts and passes training context (model, optimizer, loss) to registered hooks
- Modified `AnomalyDetectionHook.after_step` to properly check for training context and only proceed with analysis when context is available
- Added global convenience functions `end_step()` and `register_anomaly_hook()` for easy integration

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `profiler/anomaly_detection.py` - Main implementation with torch dependencies
- `profiler/anomaly_detection_simple.py` - Simplified version for testing without torch
- `profiler/__init__.py` - Updated exports

### Issue 2: Learning Rate Zero Division Crash

**Problem**: In the learning rate anomaly detector, the change ratio is computed as `abs(recent_lrs[i] - recent_lrs[i-1]) / recent_lrs[i-1]`. If a scheduler decays the learning rate to 0.0 (a common pattern when freezing layers or finishing training), this division raises `ZeroDivisionError` and terminates training rather than emitting an alert.

**Solution**:
- Added epsilon-based zero detection: `if abs(prev_lr) < self.epsilon: continue`
- Skip zero values before computing the change ratio to avoid division by zero
- Added configurable epsilon parameter (default: 1e-8) for zero detection threshold

**Code Fix**:
```python
# FIXED: Guard against division by zero when LR reaches 0
if abs(prev_lr) < self.epsilon:
    # Skip zero values to avoid division by zero
    continue

# Calculate change ratio
change_ratio = abs(curr_lr - prev_lr) / prev_lr
```

## Implementation Details

### AnomalyDetectionHook Class

```python
class AnomalyDetectionHook:
    def __init__(self, 
                 lr_change_threshold: float = 0.1,
                 lr_history_size: int = 10,
                 grad_norm_threshold: float = 10.0,
                 epsilon: float = 1e-8):
        # ... initialization ...
    
    def after_step(self, step: int, step_duration: float, **kwargs):
        """Called after each training step to analyze for anomalies."""
        # Only analyze if we have the required training context
        model = kwargs.get('model')
        optimizer = kwargs.get('optimizer')
        loss = kwargs.get('loss')
        
        if model is None or optimizer is None or loss is None:
            # If we don't have the required context, we can't perform analysis
            return
        
        # Analyze training step for anomalies
        self.analyze_training_step(step, step_duration, model, optimizer, loss, **kwargs)
```

### StepProfiler Class

```python
class StepProfiler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks: List[AnomalyDetectionHook] = []
        self.step_count = 0
    
    def end_step(self, 
                 step: int, 
                 step_duration: float,
                 model: Optional[Any] = None,
                 optimizer: Optional[Any] = None,
                 loss: Optional[Any] = None,
                 **kwargs):
        """Called at the end of each training step."""
        self.step_count = step
        
        # Call all registered hooks with the training context
        for hook in self.hooks:
            try:
                hook.after_step(
                    step=step,
                    step_duration=step_duration,
                    model=model,
                    optimizer=optimizer,
                    loss=loss,
                    **kwargs
                )
            except Exception as e:
                warnings.warn(f"Hook {hook.__class__.__name__} failed: {e}")
```

### Global Convenience Functions

```python
def get_step_profiler() -> StepProfiler:
    """Get the global step profiler instance."""
    return _global_step_profiler

def register_anomaly_hook(hook: AnomalyDetectionHook):
    """Register an anomaly detection hook with the global profiler."""
    _global_step_profiler.register_hook(hook)

def end_step(step: int, 
             step_duration: float,
             model: Optional[Any] = None,
             optimizer: Optional[Any] = None,
             loss: Optional[Any] = None,
             **kwargs):
    """Convenience function to call the global step profiler's end_step method."""
    _global_step_profiler.end_step(
        step=step,
        step_duration=step_duration,
        model=model,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        loss=loss,
        **kwargs
    )
```

## Usage Example

```python
from profiler.anomaly_detection import AnomalyDetectionHook, register_anomaly_hook, end_step

# Create and register anomaly detection hook
hook = AnomalyDetectionHook(
    lr_change_threshold=0.1,  # 10% change threshold
    lr_history_size=10,
    grad_norm_threshold=5.0,
    epsilon=1e-8
)

# Register callback for anomalies
def anomaly_callback(anomaly_type: str, anomaly_data: dict):
    print(f"ðŸš¨ ANOMALY DETECTED: {anomaly_type}")
    print(f"   Data: {anomaly_data}")

hook.register_anomaly_callback(anomaly_callback)
register_anomaly_hook(hook)

# In training loop, call end_step with training context
for step in range(num_steps):
    # ... training step ...
    
    # Call end_step with proper training context
    end_step(
        step=step,
        step_duration=step_duration,
        model=model,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        loss=loss
    )
```

## Files Created

1. `profiler/anomaly_detection.py` - Main implementation with torch dependencies
2. `profiler/anomaly_detection_simple.py` - Simplified version for testing without torch
3. `examples/anomaly_detection_demo.py` - Demo script showing usage
4. `tests/test_anomaly_detection_standalone.py` - Comprehensive test suite
5. `ANOMALY_DETECTION_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Integration

The fixes are designed to be backward compatible and easy to integrate:

1. **Existing code**: No changes required for existing code that doesn't use anomaly detection
2. **New code**: Simply import and use the new classes and functions
3. **Training loops**: Add a single call to `end_step()` with training context
4. **Hooks**: Register anomaly detection hooks as needed

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and integrates seamlessly with the profiler package structure.
