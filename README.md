Perfect. Here’s a **long, detailed README** that serves as both documentation and a *playbook* for Cursor (or Devin) to read before doing any tasks. It gives context, repo structure, goals, and acceptance criteria. You can drop this into your repo root as `README.md`, and then whenever you assign a task to Cursor you can say “read the README for context, now do M2 Profiler” etc.

# RLHF Systems Kit

This project is an open-source toolkit for **understanding, profiling, and debugging RLHF pipelines** at small scale (GPT-2 / ResNet-18 level). The aim is to **expose internals**, **optimize efficiency**, and **provide dashboards** that engineers can use immediately.

It combines:

* A **thin RLHF runner** (toy PPO loop, GPT-2 policy, toy reward model).
* A **Profiler** (time/memory breakdown, traces, flame graphs).
* A **Training Stability Dashboard** (monitor KL, drift, gradient norms, reward variance).
* A **Memory Optimizer** (per-model memory usage, batch/placement suggestions).
* **Adapters** for TRL and OpenRLHF.
* **CI + Docs** for reproducibility and adoption.

The goal is to ship something that is **practical** for engineers to run today and **credible** enough to showcase deep RL systems knowledge.

## Milestones & Acceptance Criteria

### **M1: Runner (foundation)**

Implement a thin, reproducible RLHF loop.

* GPT-2 policy model (tiny)
* Toy reward model (e.g. sentiment classifier or preference net)
* PPO loop with deterministic seed
* Logs: JSONL + TensorBoard
* Target: <2 min smoke run on CPU or single GPU
* **Acceptance:** `make train_smoke` finishes without error, writes logs and checkpoints reproducibly.

---

### **M2: Profiler (credibility core)**

Instrument stages with timers + traces.

* Stages: rollout, reward scoring, KL penalty, GAE calc, PPO update, eval
* Use `torch.profiler` to emit timeline + CSV op stats
* Optional `nsys` wrapper if installed
* **Acceptance:** `make profile` produces:

  * CSV summary (`profiles/summary.csv`) with per-stage times/memory
  * Timeline trace in JSON/HTML
  * Sum of stage times ≈ total step time

---

### **M3: Stability Dashboard (stars driver)**

Real-time + offline monitoring of RLHF health.

* Metrics: KL value, KL target error, entropy, reward mean/variance, grad-norm, clip fraction, advantage variance, tokens/sec
* Outputs:

  * Notebook `notebooks/stability_dashboard.ipynb` renders plots from disk
  * FastAPI server `scripts/serve_dashboard.py` for live charts
  * Warning banners when KL explodes, entropy collapses, or grad norms spike
* **Acceptance:** running a toy job → live dashboard shows plots, warnings trip on synthetic thresholds.

---

### **M4: Memory Optimizer (engineer magnet)**

Understand and suggest memory configs.

* Per-module CUDA memory stats: current, peak, reserved, param MB
* Tools:

  * `tools/mem_report.py` → prints memory table for actor/critic/reward/reference
  * `tools/suggest_config.py` → proposes batch size, grad-accum, placement, activation checkpointing
* **Acceptance:** suggested config runs a smoke job without OOM, reports show sane numbers.

---

### **M5: Adapters (adoption hooks)**

Enable profiling/monitoring in TRL and OpenRLHF.

* Adapter classes that install callbacks + profiler with one line
* Examples:

  * `examples/trl_integration.py` (runs TRL PPOTrainer with our hooks)
  * `examples/openrlhf_integration.py` (runs OpenRLHF PPO with our hooks)
* **Acceptance:** both scripts complete and produce the same logs + plots as the core runner.

---

### **M6: CI + Docs (trust + stars)**

Make repo reproducible and trustworthy.

* Dockerfile + `requirements.txt` + `environment.lock`
* Makefile with targets: `train_smoke`, `profile`, `dashboard`, `mem_report`, `report`, `all`
* GitHub Actions workflow: runs `make train_smoke` on CPU, builds plots, uploads artifacts
* Docs:

  * Auto-generated report `report/README.md` with figures and metrics
  * mkdocs or Sphinx site with quickstart + examples
* **Acceptance:** fresh clone → `make all` runs tiny job, builds plots, generates report; CI green on push/PR; docs site published.

---

## Quickstart (once implemented)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/rlhf-systems-kit.git
cd rlhf-systems-kit
pip install -e .
make all
```

This will:

* Run a small PPO smoke job
* Produce profiler summary + flamegraph
* Render stability dashboard plots
* Output memory report + config suggestion
* Auto-generate `report/README.md` with figures

---

## Guiding Principles

* Small scale (GPT-2 / ResNet-18) for reproducibility.
* Credibility: always include per-stage metrics, plots, and CSV logs.
* Usability: drop-in adapters for TRL/OpenRLHF.
* Reproducibility: Docker + CI + deterministic seeds.
* Communication: blog-style write-up (like Cursor/Tilde) generated from logs.
