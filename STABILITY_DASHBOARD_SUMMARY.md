## 📊 Metrics Monitored

The stability dashboard tracks the following key metrics at every training step:

### Core Stability Metrics
- **KL Divergence**: Actual vs target divergence from reference model
- **KL Target Error**: Difference between measured KL and target (0.1)
- **Policy Entropy**: Exploration vs exploitation balance
- **Reward Statistics**: Mean and variance of rewards
- **Advantage Statistics**: Mean and variance of advantages
- **Gradient Norm**: Global L2 norm of policy gradients
- **PPO Clip Fraction**: Frequency of PPO clipping
- **Throughput**: Tokens processed per second

### Instability Thresholds
- **KL > 0.2**: Potential runaway divergence
- **Entropy < 0.1**: Policy collapse
- **Gradient Norm > 1000**: Exploding gradients
- **Reward Std > 2.0**: High variance instability
- **KL Target Error > 0.15**: Poor control

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Run Training with Stability Monitoring

```bash
# Quick smoke test (<2 minutes)
make train_smoke

# This will generate:
# - runs/run_*/logs/stability.jsonl (stability metrics)
# - runs/run_*/tb/ (TensorBoard logs)
# - runs/run_*/checkpoints/ (model checkpoints)
```

### 2. Launch Live Dashboard

```bash
# Start the real-time monitoring server
make dashboard

# Dashboard will be available at: http://localhost:8000/
# Features:
# - Live-updating metric plots
# - Warning banners for threshold violations
# - Real-time stability analysis
# - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
```

### 3. View Offline Analysis

```bash
# Launch Jupyter notebook for comprehensive analysis
jupyter notebook notebooks/stability_dashboard.ipynb

# This provides:
# - Time-series plots for all metrics
# - Correlation analysis
# - Detailed instability analysis
# - Export capabilities
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Stability Logger (`monitor/logger.py`)
- **StabilityLogger**: Main class for computing and logging metrics
- **compute_stability_metrics()**: Calculates all stability metrics
- **log_metrics()**: Writes to both JSONL and TensorBoard
- **Throughput tracking**: Monitors tokens per second

### Plotting Utilities (`monitor/plot.py`)
- **load_stability_logs()**: Parses JSONL log files
- **create_stability_plots()**: Generates comprehensive dashboard
- **create_individual_plots()**: Detailed analysis of specific metrics
- **generate_stability_report()**: Text summary of issues

### Live Dashboard (`scripts/serve_dashboard.py`)
- **FastAPI server**: Lightweight web interface
- **Real-time monitoring**: Tails log files for live updates
- **Warning system**: Automatic detection of threshold violations
- **Responsive design**: Auto-refreshing plots and metrics

## 📈 Data Flow

```
Training Loop → PPO Trainer → Stability Logger → JSONL + TensorBoard
                                    ↓
                            Live Dashboard ← Tails logs
                                    ↓
                            Offline Notebook ← Reads logs
```
